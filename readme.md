# SA-SM Randomizer

Welcome to the SA-SM Randomizer project! This is a small and quirky project that randomly selects support messages from a CSV file. These messages are meant to be meaningless and funny, adding a touch of humor to your day. You are also insane if you think I would write a real readme for a project like this, no I expect it to get done in an hour. This readme is all written by AI.

## How it Works

The SA-SM Randomizer operates on a 30-day cycle. Each day, a support message is randomly selected from the CSV file. The less times a message has been selected, the higher its chances of being picked are. This ensures that messages that haven't been used recently have a better chance of being selected.

When a message is selected, it will be marked as the replacement for the previously picked message. The number of days the previous message was active will be subtracted from the 30-day count.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SA-SM Randomizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Add your support messages to the CSV file.
4. Run the randomizer script to start selecting random messages.

## Contributing

If you have any funny and meaningless support messages that you'd like to add to the randomizer, good for you!
